# Iris Flower Classification ðŸŒ¸

This project predicts the species of an Iris flower based on its petal and sepal length and width using Logistic Regression. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation
- **Model Used:** Logistic Regression  
- **Dataset:** Iris Dataset (from sklearn)  
- **Accuracy:** 97%   
- **Tech Stack:** Python, NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, Flask  
Goal
The objective of this project is to:
âœ… Build a predictive model to classify iris flowers.
âœ… Use Logistic Regression for multi-class classification.
âœ… Perform EDA to understand the dataset better.
âœ… Create a REST API using Flask to make predictions from the model.
âœ… Deploy the model using Flask.
